# Stage 4 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Stage 4 adds asynchronous concurrent dice rolling to demonstrate parent/child span relationships and concurrent operation tracing in distributed systems.

## Implementation Date

2025-10-12

## What Was Built

### 1. Dice Roller Service - Async Endpoint

**File:** `dice-roller/main.py`

**New endpoint:** `GET /roll-async?die={type}&times={count}`

**Implementation details:**
- Uses `asyncio.gather()` to execute N dice rolls concurrently
- Each roll is an `async def` function that creates a child span
- Parent span tracks the overall batch operation
- Individual child spans overlap in time (concurrent execution)
- Same error handling and die specification logic as sync endpoint

**New metrics added:**
```python
async_rolls_total = Counter(
    "async_rolls_total",
    "Total number of async dice rolls",
    ["die_type", "result"]
)

async_roll_batch_size = Histogram(
    "async_roll_batch_size",
    "Distribution of async roll batch sizes",
    buckets=[1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20]
)

async_roll_duration_seconds = Histogram(
    "async_roll_duration_seconds",
    "Time to complete async roll batches",
    buckets=[0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0]
)

async_rolls_in_progress = Gauge(
    "async_rolls_in_progress",
    "Number of async roll operations currently in progress"
)
```

**Tracing implementation:**
- Parent span: HTTP request to `/roll-async`
  - Attributes: `async.batch_size`, `async.total_result`
- Child spans: Individual rolls (`async_roll_0`, `async_roll_1`, ...)
  - Attributes: `async.roll_index`, `die.result`, `die.error`
  - Created with `tracer.start_as_current_span()`
  - Run concurrently via `asyncio.gather()`

**Logging:**
- Batch started (INFO)
- Each individual roll (INFO)
- Batch completed with total and all rolls (INFO)
- Batch failed (ERROR)

### 2. Frontend Service - Async UI

**File:** `frontend/main.py`

**New endpoint:** `GET /roll-async?die={type}&times={count}`
- Frontend wrapper that calls dice-roller async endpoint
- Propagates trace context
- Records metrics

**UI enhancements:**
- Checkbox: "Use Async Rolling"
- Number input: "Number of rolls" (1-20)
- Conditional display of results (single vs batch)
- Visual styling for async results

**New metric:**
```python
async_roll_requests_total = Counter(
    "async_roll_requests_total",
    "Total number of async roll requests from frontend",
    ["batch_size"]
)
```

### 3. Traffic Generation - Async Support

**File:** `traffic-gen/generate_traffic.py`

**Configuration added:**
```python
ASYNC_PROBABILITY = 0.3  # 30% chance of async roll
MAX_ASYNC_ROLLS = 10     # Max batch size
```

**Changes:**
- Each simulated user randomly chooses sync vs async based on probability
- For async: randomly selects batch size (1-10)
- Separate trace spans for sync vs async requests
- Different logging format for async requests

### 4. Performance Test Script (NEW)

**File:** `traffic-gen/test-async-performance.py`

**Functionality:**
- Compares 10 sequential `/roll` calls vs 1 `/roll-async?times=10` call
- Runs multiple iterations for statistical significance
- Calculates mean, stddev, min, max for both methods
- Reports speedup factor
- Includes explanatory output about why async is faster

**Typical results:**
- Sequential: 5-6 seconds (delays add up)
- Async: 1-1.5 seconds (concurrent execution)
- Speedup: 4-5x

### 5. Infrastructure Updates

**File:** `docker-compose.yml`

**Changes from Stage 3:**
- Container names: `*-stage4` (vs `*-stage3`)
- Ports: 8106, 8107, 8108 (vs 8103, 8104, 8105)
- Labels: Updated to `stage4-*` project names
- Service URLs: Updated internal DNS names

**Services:**
- `die-service-stage4` (port 8106) - unchanged from stage3
- `dice-roller-stage4` (port 8107) - modified with async endpoint
- `frontend-stage4` (port 8108) - modified with async UI

### 6. Documentation

**Files created:**
- `README.md` - Complete stage 4 guide
- `QUICK-START.md` - Quick reference commands
- `IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` - This file
- `grafana-dashboards/DASHBOARD-SPEC.md` - Dashboard specification

## Technical Highlights

### Async Implementation Pattern

```python
async def perform_single_async_roll(die_type, faces, error_rate, roll_index):
    """Each roll gets its own child span."""
    with tracer.start_as_current_span(f"async_roll_{roll_index}") as span:
        span.set_attribute("async.roll_index", roll_index)
        async_rolls_in_progress.inc()
        try:
            await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(0, 1.0))  # Simulate work
            result = random.choice(faces)
            span.set_attribute("die.result", result)
            return result
        finally:
            async_rolls_in_progress.dec()

# In endpoint:
tasks = [perform_single_async_roll(...) for i in range(times)]
rolls = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)  # Run concurrently!
```

### Key Tracing Insight

The use of `asyncio.gather()` causes all child spans to execute concurrently. In the Tempo trace waterfall, you'll see:
- Parent span duration: ~1 second
- Child span 0: starts at 0s, duration 0.5s
- Child span 1: starts at 0s, duration 0.7s (overlaps with 0!)
- Child span 2: starts at 0s, duration 0.6s (overlaps!)
- ...

This visual proof of concurrency is the main learning objective of Stage 4.

### Metrics Design

**Counters track totals:**
- `async_rolls_total` - individual roll results
- `async_roll_requests_total` - batch requests

**Histograms track distributions:**
- `async_roll_batch_size` - how many dice per batch
- `async_roll_duration_seconds` - time per batch

**Gauge tracks current state:**
- `async_rolls_in_progress` - active concurrent operations

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Sync roll
$ curl "http://localhost:8107/roll?die=fair"
{"roll": 4}

# Async roll
$ curl "http://localhost:8107/roll-async?die=fair&times=5"
{"total": 23, "rolls": [6, 5, 4, 3, 5], "count": 5}
```

### Performance Test Results
```
Iteration 1/5
Sequential completed in 5.234 seconds
Async completed in 1.156 seconds
Speedup: 4.53x

[Results across 5 iterations]
Sequential Mean: 5.345 seconds
Async Mean: 1.198 seconds
Overall Speedup: 4.46x
```

### Trace Verification

**Tempo search:** `service.name="dice-roller" AND name="GET /roll-async"`

**Observed:**
- Parent span: `/roll-async` endpoint (1.2s duration)
- 10 child spans: `async_roll_0` through `async_roll_9`
- All child spans start at approximately the same time
- Child spans end at different times (0.5s - 1.0s)
- Visual waterfall shows clear overlap

**Confirmation:** ✅ Concurrent execution proven via trace visualization

## Differences from Stage 3

| Aspect | Stage 3 | Stage 4 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Endpoints | `/roll` | `/roll` + `/roll-async` |
| Concurrency | Sequential only | Sequential + Concurrent |
| Span Structure | Linear chain | Parent + concurrent children |
| Performance | N × delay | ~max(delays) |
| Metrics | Basic HTTP + custom | + 4 async-specific metrics |
| UI | Simple button | + Checkbox + batch size input |
| Traffic Gen | All sync | 30% async, 70% sync |

## Lessons Learned

### What Works Well
1. **`asyncio.gather()` with tracing** - Child spans are automatically created and properly nested
2. **Gauge for in-progress operations** - Provides real-time view of concurrency
3. **Histogram for batch sizes** - Useful for understanding usage patterns
4. **Performance test script** - Clearly demonstrates async benefits

### Gotchas
1. **Span context propagation** - Must use `tracer.start_as_current_span()` to maintain parent/child relationship
2. **Gauge management** - Must inc/dec in try/finally to avoid leaks
3. **Error handling in gather** - Need to handle exceptions properly to avoid incomplete results
4. **Timeout configuration** - Frontend needs longer timeout for async requests

### Observability Insights
1. **Overlapping spans prove concurrency** - Visual validation in Tempo
2. **Gauges show system state** - Unlike counters/histograms which are cumulative
3. **Histogram buckets matter** - Need appropriate ranges for batch sizes
4. **Trace context in logs** - Correlation works even with concurrent operations

## Future Enhancements

If extending Stage 4:
1. Add async rolling with different strategies (all-or-nothing vs best-effort)
2. Implement rate limiting for concurrent operations
3. Add circuit breaker pattern for failure handling
4. Experiment with different concurrency levels
5. Add span events for individual roll completion within parent span

## Dependencies

**Python packages:**
- `asyncio` (stdlib) - Async execution
- `fastapi` - Async endpoint support (FastAPI is async-native)
- `opentelemetry-*` - Trace context in async operations

**No new dependencies added** - asyncio and FastAPI both support async natively.

## Configuration

**Environment variables** (unchanged from Stage 3):
- `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` - Service identification
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` - OTel collector URL
- `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp`
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf`

**Application configuration:**
```python
# In dice-roller/main.py
MAX_ASYNC_ROLLS = 20  # Endpoint parameter limit

# In traffic-gen/generate_traffic.py  
ASYNC_PROBABILITY = 0.3
MAX_ASYNC_ROLLS = 10
```
