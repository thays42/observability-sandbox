## Usage Instructions

### View Dashboard
```bash
# Open Grafana
open http://localhost:3000

# Navigate to:
# Dashboards → Dice Roller - Stage 4 (Async Rolling)
```

### Run Traffic Generation
```bash
cd /Users/thays/Projects/observability/sandbox/specs/illustrative-python/stage4/traffic-gen
source .venv/bin/activate
python generate_traffic.py
```

### Run Performance Test
```bash
cd /Users/thays/Projects/observability/sandbox/specs/illustrative-python/stage4/traffic-gen
source .venv/bin/activate
python test-async-performance.py
```

### Query Metrics
```bash
# Async roll rate
curl -s 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=rate(async_rolls_total[1m])'

# Async batch sizes
curl -s 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=async_roll_batch_size_bucket'
```

### Query Logs (via Loki API)
```bash
# Recent async logs
curl 'http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/query' \
  --get --data-urlencode 'query={container_name="dice-roller-stage4"}'
```

### View Traces
```bash
# Open Grafana Explore
open http://localhost:3000/explore

# Select Tempo datasource
# Search: service.name="dice-roller"
# Look for traces with /roll-async spans
```

## Dashboard Panels Explained

### Async Roll Metrics Row

1. **Async vs Sync Roll Rate**
   - Compares individual roll rates between sync and async endpoints
   - Sync: `rate(dice_rolls_total[1m])`
   - Async: `rate(async_rolls_total[1m])`

2. **Async Batch Size Distribution**
   - Shows P50, P95, P99 of batch sizes (times parameter)
   - Helps understand usage patterns

3. **Async Rolls In Progress**
   - Real-time gauge of concurrent operations
   - Green (0-5), Yellow (5-10), Red (>10)

4. **Total Async Rolls**
   - Cumulative count of all async rolls completed

### Async Performance Comparison Row

1. **Sync Roll Avg Duration**
   - Average time for single `/roll` requests
   - Shows baseline performance

2. **Async Batch Avg Duration**
   - Average time for `/roll-async` batches
   - Should be similar to single roll (due to concurrency)

3. **Speedup Factor**
   - Calculated ratio: Sync Duration / Async Duration
   - Expected: 3-5x for batch sizes of 5-10
   - Green when > 1 (async is faster)

## What to Look For

### In Dashboard
1. **Async roll rate increasing** when traffic generation runs
2. **Batch size distribution** shows variety of sizes (1-10)
3. **Speedup factor > 1** (async is faster than equivalent sync calls)
4. **Async rolls in progress** spikes during requests

### In Grafana Explore (Tempo)
1. Navigate to Explore → Tempo
2. Search: `service.name="dice-roller"`
3. Filter traces with `async_roll` spans
4. **Key observation:** Child spans overlap in time (concurrent execution!)

### In Logs (Grafana Explore → Loki)
```logql
{container_name="dice-roller-stage4"} | json | message =~ "Async"
```
- Look for "Async roll batch started"
- Individual "Async roll completed" entries
- "Async roll batch completed" with totals

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard not appearing
```bash
# Restart Grafana
docker compose --project-directory /Users/thays/Projects/observability/sandbox/stack restart grafana

# Check dashboard file exists
ls -lh /Users/thays/Projects/observability/sandbox/stack/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/files/stage4-dashboard.json
```

### Metrics not showing in dashboard
```bash
# Verify Prometheus is scraping
curl http://localhost:9090/targets | grep stage4

# Check metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:8107/metrics | grep async_
```

### Logs not appearing
```bash
# Check Alloy is running
docker compose --project-directory /Users/thays/Projects/observability/sandbox/stack ps alloy

# Verify stage4 in Loki
curl 'http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/label/container_name/values' | grep stage4
```

### Traffic gen script fails
```bash
# Verify venv is activated
which python
# Should show: .../stage4/traffic-gen/.venv/bin/python

# Verify services are running
curl http://localhost:8108/
```

## Files Modified

### Observability Stack
1. `/stack/alloy/config.alloy` - Added stage4 to filter
2. `/stack/prometheus/prometheus.yml` - Added stage4 scrape targets
3. `/stack/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/files/stage4-dashboard.json` - New dashboard

### Stage 4 Application
- All application files created in previous steps

## Next Steps

1. **Generate traffic** to populate dashboard with data
2. **Run performance test** to verify async speedup
3. **Explore traces** in Tempo to see concurrent spans
4. **Review dashboard panels** to understand metrics patterns
5. **Experiment** with different batch sizes and observe impact

## Success Criteria Met ✅

- [x] Grafana dashboard created with async-specific panels
- [x] Alloy collecting logs from all stage4 containers
- [x] Prometheus scraping metrics from all stage4 services
- [x] UV environment ready for traffic generation
- [x] All services healthy and responding
- [x] Metrics, logs, and traces flowing to observability stack
